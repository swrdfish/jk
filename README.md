Website for Jhinuk Construction
-------------------------------

The site is written in javascript using the awsome [keystone.js](http://keystonejs.com/) library.

#### Get Started
To start developing the site first clone the repo and then run the following commands from within the directory.

```bash
npm install

node keystone
```
**Note: you must have mongodb running for this to work**
